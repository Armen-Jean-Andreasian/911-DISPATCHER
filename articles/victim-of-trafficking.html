    <h2>Victim of Trafficking</h2>

    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Before every trip, make sure to check three important numbers:
            <ul>
                <li>The phone number of your embassy, consulate, and the responsible person.</li>
                <li>The phone number of the police and ambulance.</li>
                <li>The phone number of international human rights organizations in the country you are visiting.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If someone takes your passport in a foreign country, it's NOT A PROBLEM at all. They want you to think that you can't return without a passport, but that's not true. Contact your embassy, and they will provide you with a temporary passport, which will allow you to return. Even if you don't have money to return, your embassy can contact your government, which can arrange a free ticket for you.</li>
        <li>Never go to isolated places with locals if you are a tourist.</li>
        <li>Always leave trails behind you. Stay in touch with your friends online, take photos, and share them on social media. Try to download a taxi app, as it can provide important details about your trip and the driver's name.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Actions in Case of Being a Victim:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Check the area, your location, collect information, and analyze it.</li>
        <li>Try to escape using the following strategies:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Stay Calm and Assess the Situation: Maintain composure and gather information about your surroundings, captors, and potential escape routes.</li>
            <li>Identify Safe Opportunities: Look for moments when you might be less closely monitored or when captors' attention is diverted.</li>
            <li>Scenario 1: Normal country with normal police:</li>
            <ul>
